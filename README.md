# Portfolio Website
Portfolio Website is a simple, static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website serves as a showcase for my personal projects and experience.

## Usage
To view the website, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The website is designed to be responsive and should work on desktop and mobile devices.
You can view how the website looks on http://itzsimplyjoe.me

## Deployment
To deploy the website to a web server, simply upload the contents of the public folder to your server. The public folder contains all of the necessary files for the website, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
